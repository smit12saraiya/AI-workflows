# Weekly Grocery Assistant - n8n Workflow

An intelligent n8n workflow that automates weekly meal planning and grocery list generation using AI-powered ingredient extraction.

## üéØ Overview

This workflow helps you manage weekly meal planning by:
- Reading meal preferences from Google Sheets
- Using AI to generate detailed ingredient lists for selected meals
- Automatically updating your meal database with ingredients
- Sending weekly reminder emails to update meal plans
- Enriching meals with YouTube cooking videos

## üèóÔ∏è Workflow Architecture

```
Manual Trigger ‚Üí Google Sheets (Read) ‚Üí Process Data ‚Üí AI Ingredient Generation ‚Üí Update Database with ingredients list and Youtube video
```

### Key Components:
1. **Google Sheets Integration** - Manages meal database and preferences
2. **AI-Powered Ingredient Generator** - Uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet via OpenRouter to extract ingredients
3. **Email Notifications** - Gmail integration for weekly reminders
4. **YouTube Enrichment** - Calls sub-workflow to add cooking videos

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required n8n Credentials:
- **Google Sheets OAuth2** - For reading/writing meal data from your Google Sheets
- **OpenRouter API** - For AI-powered ingredient generation using Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- **Gmail OAuth2** - For sending weekly meal planning reminder emails

### Google Sheets Setup:
Create a Google Sheet with columns:
- `Meal Options` - Name of the dish
- `Include in Week` - Yes/No flag for weekly selection
- `Ingredients To Cook` - Auto-generated ingredient list
- `Servings` - Number of servings
- `Youtube Link` - Cooking video links (auto-populated)
- `row_number` - Unique identifier for each meal

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Import Workflow
- Import the `Weekly Grocery Assistant.json` file into your n8n instance
- The workflow will appear as "Weekly Grocery Assistant"

### 2. Configure Credentials
Replace the following credential placeholders with your own:

#### Google Sheets OAuth2:
- Node: "Get row(s) in sheet", "Update Ingredients in Meals Database", "Reset the Sheet", "Fetch meal preferences"
- **Action Required**: Set up Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials in n8n

#### OpenRouter API:
- Node: "OpenRouter Chat Model"
- **Action Required**: Add your OpenRouter API key for Claude 3.7 Sonnet access

#### Gmail OAuth2:
- Node: "Send a message"
- **Action Required**: Configure Gmail OAuth2 for sending reminder emails

### 3. Update Configuration
- **Google Sheets Document ID**: Replace `1a9XpZ_AD-r0XcJMGZgEE99sTPx766kS5NdVjBwlgNB4` with your sheet ID
- **Email Recipients**: Update email addresses in "Send a message" node
- **YouTube Enrichment Workflow**: Ensure the sub-workflow is another n8n workflow which is expert in searching the youtube for specific item and returning the most liked video for the dish selected.

## üîÑ How It Works

### Workflow Process:
1. **Manual Trigger** - Start the workflow manually / or you can add scheduled trigger
2. **Read Meal Data** - Fetches all meals from Google Sheets
3. **Reset Previous Data** - Clears old ingredient data and resets flags
4. **Send Reminder Email** - Notifies users to update meal preferences
5. **Wait Period** - 30-second delay for manual updates
6. **Process Selected Meals** - Filters meals marked "Include in Week = Yes"
7. **AI Ingredient Generation** - Uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet to generate detailed ingredient lists
8. **Format Results** - Structures ingredients for grocery shopping
9. **YouTube Enrichment** - Adds cooking videos (optional sub-workflow)
10. **Update Database** - Saves generated ingredients back to Google Sheets

### AI Ingredient Generation Features:
- Scales ingredients based on servings
- Uses common grocery units (g, ml, pcs, tbsp, tsp, cup)
- Provides realistic quantities for shopping
- Formats ingredients in readable grocery list format
- Maintains consistency across ingredient naming

## üìß Email Notifications

The workflow sends HTML-formatted reminder emails with:
- Weekly meal planning reminder
- Direct link to your Google Sheets
- Professional styling with emojis
- Automated scheduling capability

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Options

### Modify AI Behavior:
Edit the system message in "Ingredient Generator Agent" to:
- Change ingredient formatting preferences
- Adjust quantity scaling logic
- Modify dietary restrictions or preferences

### Email Template:
Customize the HTML email template in "Send a message" node for:
- Different styling
- Additional recipients
- Custom reminder frequency

### Sheet Structure:
Adapt the Google Sheets column mapping in update nodes for:
- Different column names
- Additional meal metadata
- Custom data fields

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Credential Errors**: Ensure all OAuth2 credentials are properly configured
2. **Sheet Access**: Verify Google Sheets permissions for the service account
3. **AI Generation Fails**: Check OpenRouter API key and quota limits
4. **Email Not Sending**: Confirm Gmail OAuth2 scope includes email sending

### Debug Tips:
- Use n8n's execution log to trace data flow
- Test individual nodes before running full workflow
- Verify Google Sheets document ID and sheet names
- Check AI model availability on OpenRouter

## üìù Usage Tips

1. **Weekly Routine**: Run workflow at the start of each week
2. **Meal Selection**: Mark desired meals with "Include in Week = Yes"
3. **Serving Adjustment**: Update serving counts before running workflow
4. **Grocery Shopping**: Use generated ingredient lists for shopping
5. **Recipe Videos**: Check YouTube links for cooking instructions

## ü§ù Contributing
